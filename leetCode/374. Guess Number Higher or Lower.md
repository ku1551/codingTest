## Code

    # The guess API is already defined for you.
    # @param num, your guess
    # @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
    #          1 if num is lower than the picked number
    #          otherwise return 0
    # def guess(num: int) -> int:

    class Solution:
        def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
            first, last = 1, n
            while first <= last:
                mid = first + (last - first) // 2
                res = guess(mid)
                if res == 0:
                    return mid
                elif res == -1:
                    last = mid - 1
                else:
                    first = mid + 1
            return -1
